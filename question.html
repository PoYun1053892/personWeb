                    <div class="answer">
                        <p>No, this is a beautiful feature of natural leather and the markings will be unique to you. All JUST CHILL products are lightly treated so the natural characteristics of the hide can be showcased. Since the sealant is breathable, the leather will patina over time and any scratches that occur will work themselves out. If you want to accelerate a scratch removal, you can either set the bag indirectly from a heat source to warm the wax in the finish. With a damp cloth, rub the scratch out.

                        <p>Our bag is not waterproof but we have a bunch of water repellent features. Our waxed canvas and neoprene are water repellent materials, meaning liquid will bead on the surface and not soak through. You can feel totally confident using the backpack in the rain. In order to be truly waterproof, we would need tech-y waterproofed zippers, seam tapes on all seams and all waterproof materials so that you could submerge our bag and have it come out dry on the other side. Some of our product’s charm is that it will look worn and yours over a period of time - not like a Rain Jacket.</p>
